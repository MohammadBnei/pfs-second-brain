### Context Setup

* The function takes in a `context.Context` object (`ctx`) and sets the `bookingFlowID` from the `preBookRequest` object.
* It uses the `WithBookingFlowID` and `WithABTests` functions to add additional context information.
### Logging and Timing

* The function logs the start time using a logger obtained from the context.
* A defer statement is used to log the pre-book process with relevant details (status, error message, elapsed time) when it completes or fails.

### Locking and Data Store Access

* The function uses a locker (`NewLocker`) to lock the booking process for the specified `bookingFlowID`.
* If locking fails, an error is logged, and the pre-book response is updated with the failure status.
* A data store (`datastore.NewProlongedDataStore`) is used to load and update connectivity context information.
### Connectivity Context Processing

* The function retrieves the connectivity context from the data store and checks if it has already been booked.
* If so, an error is logged, and the pre-book response is updated with a failure status.
* Otherwise, the function updates the connectivity context with the pre-book request information.
### Data Store Updates

* The function updates the data store with the new connectivity context information.
* A defer statement is used to notify an event (`EVENT_PREBOOK`) when the pre-book process completes.
### Flight Validation

* The function checks if the selected provider has a flight component and if the user has chosen a flight.
* If not, an error is logged, and the pre-book response is updated with a failure status.
### Flight Retrieval

* The function attempts to retrieve the selected flight from the connectivity context.
* If retrieval fails, an error is logged, and the pre-book response is updated with a failure status.
### Flight Selection

* The function retrieves the selected flight from the connectivity context.
* It updates the `prebookLog` object with the selected flight information.
### Room Package Validation

* The function checks if the user has chosen an accommodation board code.
* If not, it attempts to retrieve a room package based on the provided property code.
* If retrieval fails or the room package is invalid, an error is logged, and the pre-book response is updated with a failure status.
### Room Package Retrieval

* The function retrieves the selected room package from the connectivity context.
* It updates the logger with information about the room package source and board code (if applicable).
### Special Offer Handling

* The function checks if there is a special offer available for the user's booking.
* If so, it determines whether the user is eligible for the offer.
### Hotel Address Retrieval

* The function attempts to retrieve the hotel address from the connectivity context or by calling an external service (tourop_service).
* If retrieval fails, it logs an error but continues with the booking process without the address information.
### Wait Group Initialization

* A wait group (`wgBookingAdjustment`) is initialized to manage concurrent execution of the `getBookingAdjustmentsAsync` function.
* The `cBookingAdjustmentQuery` channel is created with a capacity of 1 to receive the booking adjustments.
### Booking Adjustments Retrieval

* The `getBookingAdjustmentsAsync` function is called asynchronously, passing in the `cBookingAdjustmentQuery` channel and wait group.
* The function retrieves booking adjustments based on the provided parameters (connectivity context, quote config, departure date, partner code, and current time).
### Context Preparation

* A new context (`ctx`) is created with a CPR ID set to the selected property reference ID.
### Shop Retrieval

* The function retrieves a shop object based on the brand shop code from the connectivity context.
* The shop object contains information about the partner's shop configuration.
### Mandatory Activities Validation

* The function validates if all mandatory activities are selected in the pre-book request.
* If any activity is missing, an error is logged, and a bad request response is returned.
### Pre-Booking Request Preparation

* A new request object (`req`) is created by mapping the pre-book request to the required format using the `mapPreBookRequest` function.
* The function updates the flight baggage option in the request object based on the user's selection.
### Baggage Option Validation

* If the user has selected a flight with baggage options, the function validates if the selected quantity matches any available baggage option for that flight.
* If no matching option is found, an error is logged, and a bad request response is returned.
### Margin Input Creation

* A new margin input object is created from the connectivity context using the `NewMarginInputFromContext` function.
* If an error occurs during creation, it is logged, and a bad request response is returned.
### Transfer Re-Quoting (if necessary)

* If the pre-book request includes a transfer with a specific airport or datetimes of arrival and return, the function re-quotes the transfer to get the real price.
* The `getUpToDateTransfer` function is called asynchronously to retrieve the updated transfer information.
* If an error occurs during re-quoting, it is logged, and a full transfer response is returned.
### Activities Validation

* The function validates if all activities in the pre-book request are valid based on the provided activities from the connectivity context.
* If any activity is invalid, an error is logged, and a bad request response is returned.
### Pre-Booking Request Preparation

* A new pre-booker object is created using the `NewPreBooker` function with a margin service instance.
* The selected accommodation type is stored in the context for later use on the provider side.
### Pre-Booking Execution

* The `PreBook` method of the pre-booker object is called to execute the pre-booking request.
* If an error occurs during execution, it is logged, and a response with the corresponding status code is returned.
### Get Booking Adjustment

* The function waits for the booking adjustment using `goroutineutil.WaitWithContext`.
* If an error occurs during waiting, it is logged.
* The booking adjustments are fetched from the database using `c.fetchBookingAdjustmentQueries`.
* If an error occurs during fetching, it is logged.
### Calculate Total Price

* The total price is calculated by adding the fees and discounts to the connectivity prices.
* The property customer remarks for booking confirmation are retrieved using `getPropertyCustomerRemarksForBookingConfirmation`.
### Update Quotation Items

* The quotation items are updated with the new total price.
* If there is a discrepancy between the quote and the provider's response, the difference is added to the first quotation item.
### Get Flex Insurance Price Cost

* The flex insurance price cost is retrieved using `getFlexInsurancePriceCost`.
* If an error occurs during retrieval, it is logged and handled.
* The selected flex insurance is stored in the connectivity context.
### Update Quotation Items with Flex Insurance Price

* The quotation items are updated with the new total price including the flex insurance price.
### Check for Cost Discrepancy

* The function checks if there is a cost discrepancy between the selected board and the property price.
* If there is a discrepancy, it is logged and handled.
* The same check is performed for the flight price.
### Calculate Can Absorb Amount

* The can absorb amount is calculated based on the discrepancy absorption rules.
* If the P2Q discrepancy amount is less than 0, it is added to the can absorb amount.
### Handle Price Change

* The function checks if there is a price change between the quote and the provider's response.
* If there is a price change, a price change object is created and handled.
* If not, the quotation items are updated with the new total price.
### Get Available Payment Methods

* The function `getAvailableMethods` is called to retrieve available payment methods from the payment API.
* If an error occurs during retrieval, it is logged.
* If no payment methods are found, fallback methods are applied.
### Quote Insurance

* The insurance quoter is used to quote insurances based on the pre-book request and provider's response.
* The trip price is calculated by subtracting the flex insurance price from the total price.
* The insurance quote request is created with relevant information such as brand shop, basket price, rental status, departure date, return date, passengers, and flex booking status.
### Handle Insurance Response

* If an error occurs during insurance quoting, it is logged and handled.
* The insurances are mapped from the provider's response to a local format using `insurancemapper.MapInsurances`.
* The most expensive insurance that meets the free refund eligibility criteria is kept.
### Update Pre-Book Response

* The pre-book response is updated with relevant information such as payment types, DOB required status, and price change status.
* If a price change occurs, the pre-book response status is set to WARNING and the price change object is added.
* Otherwise, the pre-book response status is set to SUCCESS.
### Update Connectivity Context

* The connectivity context is updated with the pre-book request and response.
* If contract remarks are present in the pre-book response, they are logged using `logHotelRemarks`.
### Check Data Exporter Enablement

* The `EnableDataExporter` flag in the connectivity configuration is checked.
* If it's true, the data exporter will be used to log relevant information.
### Log Pre-Book Information

* A new instance of `prebookLog` is created or reused if already initialized.
* Relevant pre-book information is logged using the `prebookLog` instance:
* Customer UUID
* Connectivity prices
* P2Q discrepancy amount
* Q2P discrepancy amount
* Total price
* Booking adjustment total price
* Flex insurance price
* Price change information (if applicable)
* Partner code
* Children, adults, and infants counts
### Return Pre-Book Response
