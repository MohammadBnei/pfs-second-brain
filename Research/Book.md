## Context Setup and Logging

* The function `Book` takes in a `context.Context` object (`ctx`) and sets the `bookingFlowID` from the `bookRequest` object using the `WithBookingFlowID` function.
* It also adds additional context information using the `WithABTests` function.
* A logger is obtained from the context using `GetLogger`, and fields are added to log the action and booking flow ID.
* The current time is recorded as `start`.

## Error Handling: Malformed Book Request

* If the `bookRequest.Code` field is empty, an error message is logged with a status of `BAD_REQUEST`.
* A `BookResponse` object is created with a status of `BAD_REQUEST`, and an internal error message indicating that the book request is malformed.
* The function returns this response immediately.

## Locker Setup

* A locker (`NewLocker`) is created to lock the booking process for the specified `bookingFlowID`.
* If locking fails, an error is logged using `util.WrapAndLog`, and a `BookResponse` object is created with a status of `TECHNICAL_FAILURE`.

## Data Store Access and Connectivity Context Retrieval

* A `datastore.ProlongedDataStore` object (`ds`) is created to access data store operations.
* The `Load()` method is called on `ds` to load any existing data. If an error occurs, a `BookResponse` object is created with a status of `TECHNICAL_FAILURE`.
* The `Get()` method is called on `ds` to retrieve the `connectivityContext`. If an error occurs:
	+ If the error is a `DataStoreKeyNotFoundError`, it indicates that the session has expired, and a `BookResponse` object is created with a status of `SESSION_EXPIRED`.
	+ Otherwise, a `BookResponse` object is created with a status of `TECHNICAL_FAILURE`.

## Connectivity Context Processing

* The retrieved `connectivityContext` is used to log additional information.
* If the `connectivityContext` indicates that the customer has already booked, a `BookResponse` object is created and returned immediately.

## Brand Shop Code Retrieval and Book Request Update

* The brand shop code is retrieved from the `connectivityContext`.
* The `bookRequest` is updated with the `brandShopCode`.

## Notification Event and Data Store Cleanup

* A notification event (`EVENT_BOOK`) is sent asynchronously using the `notifyAsync` function.
* A deferred function is used to:
	+ Store the `BookResponse` in the data store using the `storeBookResponse` function.
	+ If the response status indicates an external redirect or HTML request, expire the connectivity context data store entry after a specified duration.

## JWT Claims Retrieval and Validation

* The `auth.NewClientFromViper().GetJwtClaims()` function is called with the `provider.NewBrandShopFromBrandShopCode(brandShopCode)` object to retrieve JWT claims.
* If an error occurs (`err != nil`), a log message is created with the error details, and a `bookResponse` object is returned with a status of `FORBIDDEN`.

## Book Request Validation

* The `validateBookRequest()` function is called with the `bookRequest` and `connectivityContext` objects to validate the book request.
* If an error occurs (`err != nil`), a log message is created with the error details, and a `bookResponse` object is returned with a status of `BAD_REQUEST`.

## Pre-Booking Process

* If the `connectivityContext.ProviderPrebookRequest` object exists, it indicates that a pre-book request has been made previously.
* A new margin input object is created using the `NewMarginInputFromContext()` function.
* The `marginService` and `preBooker` objects are used to perform another pre-book request with the updated margin input.
* If an error occurs during the pre-book process, a log message is created with the error details, and a `bookResponse` object is returned with a status of `TECHNICAL_FAILURE`.
* If the pre-book response indicates that prices have changed since the previous pre-book request, the discrepancy amount is calculated and stored in the `connectivityContext`.

## Price Discrepancy Handling

* The price discrepancy amount is compared to the allowed absorption amount.
* If the discrepancy amount exceeds the allowed absorption amount, a log message is created with an error status, and the `B2RDiscrepancyNonAbsorbed` flag is set to true.
* Otherwise, the discrepancy amount is absorbed, and the `B2RDiscrepancyNonAbsorbed` flag is set to false.

## Brand-Specific Configuration and Data Retrieval

* The function checks if the brand code matches specific conditions (`"VP"` or `"VE"`).
* If a match is found, it retrieves the Veepee sale code from the product page using the `retrieveVeepeeSaleCode` function.
* The retrieved sale code is stored in the `bookRequest.PartnerData` map.

## HTTP Request and Authorization Header Retrieval

* The function checks if an HTTP request object exists in the context (`contextutil.GetHttpRequest(ctx)`).
* If not, it creates a new empty HTTP request object (`&http.Request{}`).
* The authorization header from the HTTP request is retrieved and stored in the `connectivityContext.BookRequestAuthorisation` field.

## JWT Claims and Usable Credit Handling

* The function checks if JWT claims exist and contain an email address.
* If so, it calculates the pre-booking amount, insurance amount, and promo code amount.
* It then calls the `getCredits` function to retrieve usable credit information based on the calculated amounts.
* The retrieved usable credit response is stored in the `connectivityContext.UsableCreditResponse` field.
* If the usable credit response status is not successful (`pfs.SUCCESS`), it returns a bad request book response.

## Customer UUID Retrieval and Storage

* The function checks if the payment strategy is not transaction-first and JWT claims exist with a UUID.
* If so, it retrieves the UUID from the JWT claims and stores it in the `connectivityContext.CustomerUUID` field.

## Payment Percentage Calculation and Adjustment

* The function calculates a payment percentage based on the `bookRequest` object.
* If the payment terms are set to "TwoHalf", it sets the percentage to 50.0%.
* It then checks if there are any pre-booked payments with matching terms and type, and updates the percentage accordingly.

## Try Less If Rejected Flag Calculation

* The function calculates a flag (`tryLessIfRejected`) based on the departure date of the trip and the payment percentage.
* If the departure date is more than 7 days in the future and the payment percentage is 100.0%, it sets the flag to `true`.

## Authorization and Booking Process

* The function calls the `authorizeAndBook` function to perform authorization and booking processes.
* It passes various parameters, including the context (`ctx`), data store (`ds`), brand shop code (`brandShopCode`), logger (`logger`), request headers (`r.Header`), connectivity context (`&connectivityContext`), customer UUID (`uuid`), try less if rejected flag (`tryLessIfRejected`), payment percentage (`percentage`), and real IP from the request (`httputil.RealIpFromRequest(r)`).
* If the `authorizeAndBook` function returns a non-nil response, it assigns the response to the `bookResponse` variable.

## Payment Type Assignment

* The function checks if there is a payment object in the `bookRequest`.
* If so, it assigns the payment type from the `bookRequest` to the `bookResponse`.

## Return Book Response

* The function returns the `bookResponse` as the final result.
