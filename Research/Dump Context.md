## Constants and Enums

* The `ExchangeMessageType` enum defines three types of exchange messages: `request`, `response`, and `stats`.
* The constants define time-to-live (TTL) values for cache expiration:
	+ `DefaultTTL`: 30 minutes as the default TTL for dump data cache.
	+ `QuoteTTL`: 10 minutes as the TTL for quote data stored during a client booking flow.
	+ `S3UploadMaxRetry` and `S3UploadRetryDelay`: maximum retry attempts (3) and delay between retries (1 second) for uploading to S3.

## Struct Definition

* The `DumpTransport` struct represents a transport mechanism for dump data:
	+ It has four fields:
		- `QuoteCode`: a string representing the quote code.
		- `Source`: a string indicating the source of the data.
		- `redis`: an instance of `redis.Cmdable`, which is likely used for caching or storing data in Redis.
		- `roundTripper`: an instance of `http.RoundTripper`, which is used to make HTTP requests.
		- `preventDataLeak`: a function pointer (`DumpLeakPreventionFunc`) that prevents data leaks.

## Key Constants

* The `dumpSourceKeyType` enum defines two types of dump source keys:
	+ `dumpSourceKey`: a key for storing dump data.
	+ `dumpSetExpirationKey`: a key for setting expiration on stored dump data.

## Context Functions

* The `WithDumpSource` function adds a new value to the context with key `dumpSourceKey` and value `source`. This allows for storing the source of data in the context.
* The `WithDumpSetExpiration` function sets a flag to prolong all entries within a set of data until expiration. It adds a new value to the context with key `dumpSetExpirationKey` and value `expiration`.
* The `DumpSource` function retrieves the source string from the context using the `dumpSourceKey`. If the key is not present, it returns an empty string and false.
* The `DumpSetExpiration` function retrieves the expiration duration from the context using the `dumpSetExpirationKey`. If the key is not present, it returns 0 and false.

## DumpTransport Methods

* The `WithSource` method updates the `Source` field of a `DumpTransport` instance with the provided `source` string. It returns a new `DumpTransport` instance with the updated source.
* The `NewDumpTransport` function creates a new `DumpTransport` instance and initializes its fields using the provided context, Redis client, source, brand code, quote code, and round tripper.

## NewDumpTransportWithLeakPrevention

* This function creates a new `http.RoundTripper` instance with leak prevention enabled.
* If the brand doesn't have network dumps enabled, it returns the default HTTP transport.
* If there's no UUID (quote code), it returns the default HTTP transport.
* If the round tripper is nil, it defaults to the standard HTTP transport.
* Otherwise, it calls `NewDumpTransportObject` with the provided context, source, Redis client, quote code, round tripper, and leak prevention function.

## NewDumpTransportObject

* This function creates a new `DumpTransport` instance with the provided parameters:
	+ Quote code
	+ Source
	+ Redis client
	+ Round tripper
	+ Leak prevention function

## isDumpEnabled

* This function checks if network dumps are enabled for a given brand code.
* It uses the `viper` library to retrieve a list of excluded brands and checks if the provided brand code is in that list. If it's not, it returns true (i.e., network dumps are enabled).

## getDumpExchangeKey

* This function generates a unique key for an exchange within a tunnel.
* It takes three parameters: exchange ID, source, and message type.
* The key includes the current timestamp, exchange ID, source, and message type.

## getDumpQuoteKey

* This function generates a unique key for storing quote data in the cache.
* The key format is "dump:quote:<quote_code>" where <quote_code> is the actual quote code.

## PutRequestManually and PutRequestManuallyWithWg

* These functions put a request message into the dump transport with manual execution.
* They generate a new exchange ID using `xid.New()` and call the `putMsg` method to send the message.
* The difference between these two functions is that `PutRequestManuallyWithWg` takes an additional `wg *sync.WaitGroup` parameter, which allows for synchronization of multiple goroutines.

## PutResponseManually and PutResponseManuallyWithWg

* These functions put a response message into the dump transport with manual execution.
* They take an exchange ID as input and call the `putMsg` method to send the message.
* Like the request functions, these two functions differ in that `PutResponseManuallyWithWg` takes an additional `wg *sync.WaitGroup` parameter for synchronization.

## PutStatsManually and PutStatsManuallyWithWg

* These functions put statistics into the dump transport with manual execution.
* They take extended stats as input, marshal them to JSON, and call the `putMsg` method to send the message.
* Like the request and response functions, these two functions differ in that `PutStatsManuallyWithWg` takes an additional `wg *sync.WaitGroup` parameter for synchronization.

## putMsg

* This is a method of the `DumpTransport` struct that puts a message into the dump transport.
* It takes several parameters: context, logger, content (the actual message), exchange ID, and message type (ExchangeRequest, ExchangeResponse, or ExchangeStats).
* This function puts a message into the dump transport, linking it to the given UUID and storing it in Redis.
* It takes several parameters: context, logger, content (the actual message), exchange ID, and message type (ExchangeRequest, ExchangeResponse, or ExchangeStats).
* The function first checks if the `DumpTransport` instance is valid and has a Redis connection.

## Key Generation

* The function generates a key for storing the message in Redis using the `getDumpExchangeKey` function.
* The key format is "dump:exchange:<exchange_id>:<source>:<message_type>" where <exchange_id> is the actual exchange ID, <source> is the source of the message, and <message_type> is the type of the message.

## Data Compression and Encryption

* The function compresses the payload using Snappy.
* If a data leak prevention mechanism is enabled, it applies the mechanism to the content before compression.

## Redis Operations

* The function sets the compressed content in Redis with an expiration time (TTL) using the `Set` method of the Redis connection.
* It checks if there's an error during the set operation and logs it if so.
* If the message is a "perfectstay" request, it refreshes the TTL for all previous keys in the same set.

## pushAndExpire

* This function pushes the key to the set and expires it after a certain time using Redis operations.
* It takes three parameters: set name, key name, and expiration time.
* This function pushes a value to a key representing a list in Redis and sets the list's expiration.
* It takes three parameters: key name, value string, and expiration delay time duration.
* The implementation details are not shown here, but it likely involves using Redis operations to store the value in the list and set its TTL.

## goroutineutil.RecoverL

* This function recovers from any panics that occur during the execution of the `putMsg` function.
* It's used to prevent crashes due to unhandled panics.


## dumpRequest

* This function dumps an HTTP request into a byte array for later processing.
* It takes two parameters: the HTTP request object and the exchange ID string.
* The function uses the `DumpRequestOut` method from the `httputil` package to dump the request.
* If there's an error during dumping, it logs the error with a warning level if the context is canceled, or an error level otherwise.

## dumpResponse

* This function dumps an HTTP response into a byte array for later processing.
* It takes four parameters: the context object, logger entry, HTTP response object, and exchange ID string.
* The function checks if the response content is gzipped by checking the "content-encoding" header.
* If it's gzipped, it unzips the content using the `gzip.NewReader` method from the `ioutil` package.
* It then dumps the response using the `DumpResponse` method from the `httputil` package.
* If the body is not included in the dump (because it's gzipped), it appends the unzipped payload to the dumped response.
* The function logs any errors that occur during dumping and calls the `putMsg` function to store the dumped response.

## dumpStats

* This function dumps HTTP statistics into a byte array for later processing.
* It takes five parameters: the context object, logger entry, start time, HTTP statistics result, and exchange ID string.
* The function calculates the end time by calling `time.Now()`.
* It updates the end time in the HTTP statistics result using the `End` method from the `httpstat` package.
* It creates an `ExtendedStats` struct with the updated HTTP statistics result, start time, and end time.
* It marshals the extended statistics into a JSON byte array using the `json.Marshal` function.
* If there's an error during marshaling, it logs the error at the error level.
* The function calls the `putMsg` function to store the dumped statistics.

## RoundTrip

* This function is part of the `DumpTransport` struct and implements the `RoundTripper` interface from the `net/http` package.
* It takes an HTTP request object as input and returns an HTTP response object along with any error that occurred during the round trip.
* The function gets the context object, logger entry, and exchange ID string from the request context.
* It dumps the original request using the `dumpRequest` method.
* It adds support for HTTP statistics by creating a new `httpstat.Result` struct and setting it as the context's HTTP statistics result using the `WithHTTPStat` function from the `httpstat` package.
* It records the start time of the round trip.
* It performs the actual round trip using the `RoundTrip` method from the `roundTripper` field of the `DumpTransport` struct.
* If there's an error during the round trip, it returns the response and error as is.
* The function dumps the HTTP response using the `dumpResponse` method.
* It dumps the HTTP statistics using the `dumpStats` method.
